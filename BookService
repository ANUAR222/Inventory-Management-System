//Then, we'll create a BookService class that injects the BookRepository and defines methods for creating, updating, and deleting books:

@Service
public class BookService {

    @Autowired
    private BookRepository bookRepository;

    public Book createBook(Book book) {
        return bookRepository.save(book);
    }

    public Book updateBook(Book book) {
        return bookRepository.save(book);
    }

    public void deleteBook(Long id) {
        bookRepository.deleteById(id);
    }
}
